#### Wildfire Smoke Detection Challenge
Do you know there are more than 250 cameras installed around mountaintop in California. These are the AlertWildfire camera system. Another camera system is called HPWREN cameras.

- [AlertWildfire Cameras](http://www.alertwildfire.org/southeastbay/index.html?v=518dd6a)

- [HPWREN Cameras](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/cameras/I/wc-e-mobo-c.html)

Can you build a wildfire smoke detector for these cameras ? 

We launched these Wildfire Smoke Detection Challenge IA, IB and II in conjunction of the **[Letâ€™s Stop Wildfires Hackathon](https://github.com/aiformankind/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon)**. 
You can use your solution as the entry to the Let's Stop Wildfire Hackathon. 

Note: You have to create a github repo with your solution as part of the submission.

Learn more about the challenges. Note: You can find more about the train datasets in the following links.
